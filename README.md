# Rock paper scissors game
## What
As making progress in the course web develloper we're now tackling some more difficult parts in javascript. This exercise is about making the well known rock paper scissors game.
## Why

## How
The primary goal is to build the game using javascript. Also HTML of course and CSS for making it appealing to the viewer.
